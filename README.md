# Odin Recipes

## About
This project is a website I built following along _The Odin Project_ on [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The skills I will demonstrate in this project are:
  - HTML
    - Creating html file, writing boilerplate HTML
    - Working with HTML tags and elements to:
      - Create an _ordered_ and *unordered* list
      - Create [Links](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images) and Images 
      - General text elements
  - Git 
    - Used Git commands to manage my project
    ```
    git clone
    git status
    git add
    git commit -m "Commit Message"
    git push origin main
    ```
