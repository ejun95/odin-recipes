      <h2 class='subtitle'>Description</h2>
      <p>Chicken adobo, the quintessential Filipino comfort food, is a fragrant, deeply savory stew that marries the subtle sweetness of soy sauce with the bright acidity of vinegar and the earthy depth of bay leaves and garlic. The final result is a perfectly balanced dish—sweet, tangy, and slightly salty, with a hint of aromatic spice—served steaming over fluffy white rice or paired with a crisp green salad, making it a timeless, heart warming centerpiece for any meal.</p>
