      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface.</li>
        <li>Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside. </li>
        <li>Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press.</li>
        <li>Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)</li>
        <li>Serve musubi warm or chilled.</li>
